3. then type password
4. trying commands
	1. cd ~
		- file system starts at home
	2. cd <file>
		- file system starts at <file>
	3. ls -lat
		- brings up a list of hidden files
		- does -a, -l, and -t things at the same time
	4. ls -l
		- number of public files and public files
	5. ls  -a 
		- brings up files
	6. ls  <directory> 
		- access denied (could be because their password isn’t work atm)
		- brings up accounts public folders
	7. ls -t 
		- brings up public folders
	8. cp <directory>
		- permission denied
	9. to close/disconnect
		- exit or crlt-d

having windows causes the need for different commands (e.i. dir instead of ls)
cd works the same
